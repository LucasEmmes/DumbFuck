# DumbFuck
DumbFuck - a BrainFuck Compiler


### General Idea  

Writing stuff in brainfuck is very hard, at least once you need to make a few operations.  
The general idea of dumbfuck is to have a compiler that takes assembly-esque code and  
"compiles" it to standard brainfuck code.

### (Future) Features Include:  
1. Easy variables  
2. Functions  
3. If / Else statements  


Do note that brainfuck does not have GOTO functionality (at least I failed to find any),  
so while you are totally fine to have nested function calls, recursion or any circular function calls will fail.
